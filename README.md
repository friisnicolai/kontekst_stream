# Kontekst Stream
Asynchronous persistent streams for Flutter. Send and receive events in Flutter using streams that have their data persisted on disk and/or in a cloud storage.

Use cases:
- Async collection and storage of data, for example events
- Async reliable messaging between apps, components, isolates and native processes
- Decoupling of consumers and producers of events, messages and data
